Application written purely in JAVA that has few "sub functions" such as :

- Simple calculator that handles :
    - basic mathematic operations (In symbols : +,-,*,/)
    - square root / power
    - percentage
- Programming calculator which:
    - has build in basic calculator (no fractional numbers)
    - converts number from one numeric system to other (Decimal,Binary,Hexadecimal,Octal)
        - all conversion are visible at once
        - at any moment user can change input type
- Currency converter
    - data is taken online from NBP (Narodowy Bank Polski, in english : Polish National Bank) in XML format
    - NOTE : XML file isn't very up to date at any given time from what i noticed. Data table is issued once per day - as if they update that file more than once? I'm not really sure.

## Libraries

This application was purely written using only SWING library. One external library / API used is free to use custom Look and Feel called FlatLaf made by FormDev : (https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf/), if library is absent or exception happen, standard LaF will be used.


## About

Application was written purely for practice only, (inspiration was taken from build-in calculator in Windows) since i just started learning JAVA language and programming practices in general, so SOLID principle, DRY or design pattern basically don't exist, at least not applied to a whole project.

Im not planning to come back to this repo very regularly to expand this application, since this project was just for learning purposes only. As it was said in one book - i need to write code, a lot. So, for now im just making new projects and hopefully they will be better and better.
